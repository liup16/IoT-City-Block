# IoT-Smart-City-Block
Cloud Based Smart Safety and Security System

The smart safety and security system was inspired by my first-hand experiences with natural disasters back home in Yangon, Myanmar. In April 2008 and July 2015, Cyclone Nargis and Cyclone Komen hit Myanmar, flooding up to 11 states (out of 14) in the country. Clean water that city dwellers took for granted became severely scarce overnight. Many suffered amoebic dysentery due to the lack of access to purified water. Thousands were trapped in their own homes due to floods, following the cyclones that tore apart many homes in villages and cities. These fatalities and tragic consequences can be avoided, if not mitigated, if only there was some sort of an early warning system.

My IoT project attempts to simulate a city block prone to various natural and manmade disasters: wild fires, neighborhood fires, floods, and overcrowding. Using local sensors (proximity, temperature, and water level sensors), my IoT system sends sensor readings to the cloud, executes cloud computation, and receives alert triggers and important city statistics/information from my own city block and another city block. Upon receiving alert triggers after successful http requests, local actuation is made depending on what the alert triggers are. My city block is also capable of smart street lighting based on incident light intensity, so that citizens are provided sufficient street lighting at any time of the day, when necessary and without wasting electricity.
